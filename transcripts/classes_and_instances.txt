Hey, everybody. How's [it] going in this series of videos?
00:02
We'll be learning how to create and use classes within python and how object-oriented concepts are applied within the language now
00:09
There's a lot to cover when working with classes, so I'm going to break these up into several different videos
00:13
We'll cover the basics of creating and instantiating classes will learn about inheritance class and instance variables
00:19
static methods and class methods and Several other topics
00:22
So breaking these up in several videos will allow us to focus on specific topics in each video so in this video
00:29
We'll be learning the basics of creating and instantiating simple classes, but first
00:34
Why should we even use classes now this isn't just specific to
00:37
Python you can see classes being used throughout most modern programming languages, and there's a good reason for that
00:43
they allow us to
00:44
Logically group our data and functions in a way that's easy to [reuse] and also easy to build upon if need be
00:51
Now just a quick side note when I say data and functions that are associated with a specific class
00:56
We call those attributes and methods, and you'll hear me use those terms a lot throughout these videos, so when I say methods
01:02
I mean a function that is associated with a class
01:07
[so] let's go ahead and get started so say we had an application for our company
01:11
And we wanted to [represent] our employees and our python code now
01:15
This would be a great use case for a class because each individual employee is going to have specific
01:20
Attributes and methods so for example each employee is going to have a name and email address [a] pay and also
01:28
Actions that they can perform so it'd be nice if we had a class
01:31
That we could use as a blueprint to create each employee so that we didn't have to do this manually each time from scratch
01:38
So let's go ahead and create a simple employee class and see what that would look like so to create a class
01:44
It's just as easy as saying class employee now
01:48
I'm going to leave this empty for now, and if we just left it like this and we get an error
01:52
so if you ever have a class or a function [that] you want to leave empty for the time being then you can simply put
01:57
In a past statement and python will know that you just want to skip that for now
02:02
So now we have a simple employee class with no attributes or methods
02:06
And I wanted to stop here because I wanted to explain the difference between a class and an instance of a class
02:13
So our class is basically a blueprint for creating
02:17
Instances and each unique employee that we create using our employee class will be an instance of that class
02:24
so for example if I said employee 1 equals employee and
02:29
EmPLoyee 2
02:31
Equals employee then each of these are [going] to be their own unique instances of the employee class
02:38
so for example if I go ahead and print both of these out and
02:45
Copy and paste that
02:47
There and you can see that both of these are employee objects, and they're both unique
02:53
They both have different locations here in memory now
02:55
This is an important distinction because you'll hear me talk a lot about
02:59
instance variables and class variables and it's important to know the difference between those and I'll go more in depth into class variables in the
03:06
next video but for this video
03:08
We're going to be looking at instance variables so instance variables contain Data that is unique to each instance
03:14
Now we could manually create instance variables for each employee by doing something like this
03:20
So let's say we wanted employee 1 to have a first name and a last name so I could just do employee 1 not first
03:28
Equals Corey and then I could do employee last
03:34
is
03:36
equal to
03:37
Schaefer and I could also give it an email address, so I'll do employee 1 dot email equals
03:44
and I'll just do the first name with the last name at
03:49
Company comm and lastly let's go ahead and add a pay [onto] there too, so I'll do employee 1 not pay and we'll just do
03:57
50,000 there now let's give employee to
04:01
Some of these same attributes so for this one. I'll just do test
04:06
User and then I'll do test
04:10
User and I will make that
04:13
60,000 ok so now each of these instances have attributes that are unique to them
04:19
so if I print it out, let's say I could print out the employee [1] dot mail and
04:26
Also print out the employee to email
04:31
On it looks like whenever I gave these the instance variables
04:35
I forgot to make this employee to here so now let's run that so now you can see that that email
04:40
Was created for each employee?
04:43
[let's] say that we wanted to set all of this information for each employee
04:46
When they're created rather than doing all of this manually like we did here
04:51
So we wouldn't want to have to
04:53
Manually set these variables every time you can see it's a lot of code and it's also prone to mistakes
04:58
Just like I did whenever I forgot to change the [to] employee, [too]
05:03
So we don't get much benefit of using classes if we did it this way, so to make these
05:09
Set up automatically when we create the employee we're going to use a special init method
05:14
So now inside of our employee class I'm going to create this special init method
05:20
Now you can think of this method as initialize and if you're coming from another language
05:25
Then you can think of this as the constructor now when we create methods within a class they [receive] the instance as the first argument
05:34
Automatically and by convention. We should call the instance self now. You can call it
05:39
Whatever you want
05:40
But it's a good idea to stick to convention here and just use self
05:44
So after self we can specify what other arguments that we want to
05:49
Accept so let's go ahead and accept the first name the [last] name and the pay and I know that we had email, too
05:56
But we can create the email using the first name and the last name so now within our and Knit method
06:02
We're going to set all of these instance variables
06:06
So let's do self dot first equals first and now I'm just going to do this for the rest of them as well
06:14
So [I'm] going to do self dot pay or self dot last and self dot pay and for the email
06:20
I can do self dot email equals first plus
06:24
and then we'll put a dot between those and then last and then we'll add on to the end at
06:32
company comm
06:34
Okay, so whenever I say that self is the instance what I mean by [that] is that when we self dot first?
06:42
equals [two] first here
06:43
It's going to be the same thing as us saying down here that employee one dot first equals
06:49
[Korey] except now instead of doing this manually
06:53
It'll be done automatically when we create our employee objects
06:57
Now these don't need to be the same as our arguments so for example. I could make this
07:03
Self dot f name equals first, but I usually like to keep these similar if possible
07:09
So I'm going to go ahead and set that back [to] self dot first equals first, okay?
07:14
So now when we create our instances of our employee class right here now
07:19
we can pass in the values that we
07:21
specified in our anit method now our net method takes the instance which we call itself and the first name last name and
07:28
Pay as arguments, but when we create our employee down here the instance is passed automatically
07:36
So we can leave off self we only need to provide the names and the pay so we could create these by
07:43
Passing in first and we have to do this in order
07:46
So I will pass in all of the same information that we did manually down there and for the second one
07:53
I'll do [test] and
07:55
User and I think I had that at
07:59
[sixty] [thousand] okay
08:00
so what would happen on this line when we create this employee the anit method will [be] run automatically, so
08:09
Employee one will be passed in as self and then it will set all [of] these attributes
08:14
So it'll set employee one dot first is equal to first which we passed in as quarry
08:21
Employee one that last equals what we passed in is last and so on so now that we have that an it method in place
08:28
We can go [ahead] and delete these manual assignments that we made down here
08:33
And you can see by deleting that that we got rid of a lot of code
08:36
So I'm going to go ahead and comment out those lines
08:39
[we're] printing [the] employees, and I'm just going [to] go ahead and print out the email
08:43
So if I run that then you can see that that still works, okay?
08:47
So everything that we have so far [like] the names and email and the pay are all attributes of our class now
08:54
Let's say that we wanted the ability to perform some kind of action not to do that
08:58
We can add some methods to our class
09:00
So let's say [that] I wanted the ability to display the full name of an employee now
09:05
This is an action that you'd likely need to do a lot with a class like this
09:09
So we can do this manually outside the class if I was to come down here and do
09:16
Print and I could get the full name just by putting in two
09:20
placeholders there and doing a format and saying employee one dot first and
09:27
Employee one dot last and if I go ahead and print this out
09:33
And you can see that we got the full name there
09:36
But that's a lot to type in each time that you want to display the employees full name, [so] instead
09:42
Let's create a method within our class that allows us to put this functionality in one place, so within our class here
09:49
I'm going to create a method called full name and we can do that with just doing a death of
09:56
Full name now [like] I said before each method within a class
10:01
Automatically takes the instance as the first argument
10:03
and
10:04
We're going to always call [that] self and the instance is the only argument that we'll need in order to get the full name
10:12
So within this method here
10:15
I'm just going [to] take the same logic that we had down here and cut that out
10:20
and I'm just going to go ahead and return that but we have to be careful here because
10:25
now instead of printing Employee [1]
10:29
[first-name] and [lastname], [I'm] going to use self so that it will work [with] all instances
10:35
So I'm going to do self dot first and self dot last
10:38
So now that we created that method instead of printing like we did before now
10:43
I can just come down [here] and do employee 1 dot full name and
10:49
Print that out
10:49
And if I run that then you can see that we got the same [thing] and notice that we need the parentheses here
10:55
Because this is a method instead of an attribute
10:58
So if I left the parentheses off and printed this then you can see that it prints the method instead
11:05
[of] the return value of the
11:07
method so we're going to have to put those parentheses on in order to run that properly so now we have full advantage of
11:14
Code reviews here, so instead of typing this out for each full name that I want to print now
11:19
I can just use that method so now if I wanted to print employee two's full name
11:23
It's just as easy as replacing employee one with employee two and running that and we get the correct answer
11:31
Okay, and one more quick thing that I wanted [to] point out here
11:35
Now one common mistake that I see when creating methods is forgetting the self argument for the instance
11:42
So let's take a quick look at what that would look like if we left that off
11:46
so now before I run this if I just comment it out this printing of full name down here and
11:52
Ran this then you can see I'm actually going to remove these print statements here as well
11:57
Now [you] can see that this runs without any errors
12:00
But if I was to try to run this method that we accidentally left self off of then
12:06
Run this and you can see that we get an error and the error that we got was a type error
12:12
full-name takes zero positional arguments
12:15
But one was given now this can be confusing because it doesn't look like we're passing any arguments here into full name
12:22
But the instance which in this case is employee two is getting passed automatically
12:28
So we have to expect that instance argument in our method, and that's why we added self
12:34
so I'm going to come back up [here] to full name and
12:37
Put self back in and now running this you can see that [it] runs
12:41
Correctly now we can also run these methods using the class name
12:47
Itself which makes it a bit more obvious of what's going on in the background because whenever we do that, so I'll do employee
12:56
Dot full name now [when] we run it from the class we have to manually pass in the instance as an argument
13:04
So in this case
13:04
I'll pass in employee one so you can see how these are similar, but not exactly the same
13:10
So I'm going to put these side-by-side just so that we can compare them here
13:14
So these two lines here do the exact [same] thing, but here when I do employee one
13:20
Which is a instance and I call the method. I don't need to pass in self
13:25
It does it automatically and when we call the method on the class
13:30
And it doesn't know what?
13:31
instance that we want to run that method with so we do have to pass in the instance and that gets passed in as
13:37
self and if I go [ahead] and
13:40
Print this out and run it then you can see that it works
13:44
Just like if we were to print out the employee one dot full name
13:48
And I wanted to show you that because that's actually what's going on in the background
13:52
when we run employee one dot full name it gets transformed into this here employee dot full name and
14:00
Passes in employee one as self and that's why we have self for these methods, so I hope that makes sense to you
14:07
That's not extremely important to know when we're just getting started with working with classes
14:12
But we need to understand that [in] later videos once we start inheriting from other classes and things like that
14:18
So I figured it would be a good thing to go ahead, and show you that now okay?
14:22
So I think that's going to do it for this video in this video
14:25
We learned how to create simple classes the difference between a class and an instance of that class and we also learned how to initialize
14:33
class attributes and create methods now
14:36
We still have a lot to cover in future videos, and we'll be going over more advanced topics, so in the next video
14:41
We'll learn about class variables, and how they differ from instance variables that we saw here
14:46
