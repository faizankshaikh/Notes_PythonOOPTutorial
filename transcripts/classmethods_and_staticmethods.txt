00:00
hey everybody how's it going in our last
00:02
video we looked at the difference
00:03
between instance variables and class
00:04
variables and in this video we'll be
00:06
learning about the difference between
00:07
regular methods class methods and static
00:11
methods and a lot of people get confused
00:12
as to the difference between class
00:14
methods and static methods so we'll
00:16
definitely go over that in detail so as
00:19
we learned in our previous videos
00:20
regular methods in a class automatically
00:24
take the instance as the first argument
00:26
and by convention we were calling this
00:29
self so if a regular method
00:31
automatically takes in the instance as
00:33
the first argument then how can we
00:35
change this so that it instead
00:37
automatically takes the class as the
00:39
first argument now to do that we're
00:41
going to use class methods and to turn a
00:43
regular method into a class method it's
00:46
as easy as adding a decorator to the top
00:49
called class method so let's go ahead
00:52
and create one of these so I'm going to
00:54
create a new method here with that class
00:56
method decorator and I'm just going to
00:58
call this set raised amount now for this
01:02
set raised amount method I'm going to
01:05
take in the class and I'm going to take
01:07
in an amount and for now we'll just put
01:09
in a pass statement there now if you'd
01:12
like to learn more about how decorators
01:13
work then you can watch my video that
01:15
goes into that in depth but basically
01:18
this is altering the functionality of
01:20
our method to where now we receive the
01:22
class as our first argument instead of
01:25
the instance now by convention with a
01:27
regular method we called this instance
01:29
variable self and there's a common
01:33
convention for class variables too and
01:35
that is CLS now we can't use the word
01:38
class as the variable name here because
01:41
the word has a different meaning within
01:43
the language you can see here at up at
01:46
the top that we use the word class to
01:48
create a new class so that is a keyword
01:51
in Python so instead we're going to use
01:53
CLS as our class variable name so now
01:55
within this set raise amount method we
01:58
are working with the class instead of
02:01
the instance and to show you what I mean
02:03
by this let's go ahead and set our class
02:05
variable raise amount so we'll say class
02:09
dot raise amount and we'll just set this
02:13
equal to the amount argument that we are
02:17
accepting from this method so now down
02:19
here at the bottom I still have these
02:21
two employee instances that I created in
02:23
our previous tutorials and Here I am
02:26
printing out the classes raised amount
02:28
as well as both instances raised amounts
02:32
so if I go ahead and run this then you
02:35
can see that all of those are equal to
02:36
4%
02:37
now the reason all those are equal to 4
02:39
percent again is because we have this
02:41
class variable here raised amount that
02:43
is set to 4% so now let's say that we
02:46
wanted to change this to 5%
02:49
so before I print these out then I could
02:52
just use that raised set raise amount
02:54
method that we just created and I could
02:56
do employee dot set raise amount and it
03:01
automatically accepts the class so we
03:04
don't have to pass that in so now we can
03:06
just pass in an amount so I'm going to
03:08
go ahead and do 5% and if I save that
03:11
and run it and you can see that now all
03:14
of these are equal to 5% now the reason
03:17
all those are equal to 5% is because we
03:19
ran this set raise amount method which
03:22
is a class method which means that now
03:24
we are working with the class instead of
03:27
the instance and we're setting that
03:29
class variable raise amount equal to the
03:32
amount that we passed in here which is
03:34
5% so really us running this set raise
03:37
amount method here and setting this CLS
03:41
variable raise amount to the amount is
03:43
the same thing as us saying employee dot
03:46
raise amount equals 5% but now we are
03:51
using this class method to do that
03:53
instead now you can run class methods
03:55
from instances as well but that doesn't
03:58
really make a lot of sense and I don't
04:00
ever see people doing it but to show you
04:02
what that would look like I can also
04:04
grab this instance here and I can run
04:08
that class method from the instance and
04:11
if I run that you can see that running
04:14
that class method from the instance
04:15
still changes that class variable and
04:18
sets all of the class variable and both
04:22
instance amounts to that 5 percent that
04:25
we passed in now you may also hear
04:27
people say
04:27
that they use class methods as
04:29
alternative constructors now what do
04:32
they mean by this so what they mean is
04:33
that you can use these class methods in
04:36
order to provide multiple ways of
04:38
creating our objects so let's say that
04:41
for example we had someone who is using
04:43
our employee class and they said hey I
04:46
have these specific use cases where I'm
04:49
getting employee information in the form
04:51
of a string that is separated by hyphens
04:53
and I'm constantly needing to parse the
04:56
string before I create new employees so
05:00
is there a way to just pass in a string
05:01
and create an employee from that so
05:05
let's go ahead I have an example down
05:07
here to where we can see exactly what
05:11
this problem would look like so let's
05:13
say that this is a common use case for
05:14
how someone is using our class we have
05:17
three strings here that are employees
05:22
separated by hyphens so we have the
05:24
first name the last name and the salary
05:26
and they're all in a string and they're
05:28
separated by hyphens now if I wanted to
05:31
create a new employee from this string
05:33
then what I would have to first do is I
05:36
would have to split this string on the -
05:40
and then we'd have our first name last
05:42
name and our pay and then based on those
05:45
values we would be able to create a new
05:48
employee by passing in those values and
05:51
that would run our a knit method so now
05:54
let me go ahead and save this and run it
05:57
and you can see that this works we're
06:00
splitting the string up into a first
06:02
name last name and pay and then we are
06:05
creating a new employee just like we did
06:07
up here out of those values that we
06:09
parse from the string and you can see
06:11
that it works because we're printing out
06:13
that new employees email and pay and
06:15
everything is as it should be but if
06:17
this is a common use case for how
06:19
someone is using our class and we don't
06:21
want them to have to parse these strings
06:22
every time that they want to create a
06:24
new employee so let's just create an
06:27
alternative constructor that allows them
06:29
to pass in the string and we can create
06:31
the employee for them so I'm going to go
06:34
ahead and come up here and create a new
06:37
class method and we're going to use this
06:41
new
06:41
method as an alternative constructor and
06:43
usually these start with the from but
06:46
that's just a convention also but I'm
06:48
going to call this from string and
06:51
remember that we automatically accept
06:53
the class as the first argument there
06:55
and I'm just going to call this second
06:58
argument employee string and now we're
07:01
just going to go ahead and parse this
07:02
string for them so exactly what we did
07:05
down here I'm just going to grab this
07:07
line first name last name and pay and
07:10
I'm going to go ahead and put this in
07:12
our class method but now instead of
07:15
working with this specific string I'm
07:18
going to split the string that they pass
07:21
to this method so instead of employee
07:23
string one I'm going to use this
07:26
employee string argument from this
07:28
method here and down here at the bottom
07:30
we created our new employee by saying
07:33
employee and then passing in those
07:36
variables that we got when we split but
07:39
now that we're inside of our class
07:41
method we can do the exact same thing
07:43
but now we're going to use our class
07:44
variable instead of employee because
07:46
those are the same thing
07:48
so I'm going to go ahead and grab this
07:50
line here and paste it in but now I'm
07:53
going to use this class instead of
07:56
employee since that's basically the same
07:58
thing so this line is going to create
08:01
that new employee and now that we've
08:03
created that new employee we also need
08:05
to return it so that they can receive
08:08
that employee object when this method is
08:10
called so I'm just going to return that
08:13
new employee object okay so now our
08:16
alternative constructor is done so now I
08:18
can delete this line here and now
08:21
instead of someone needing to parse the
08:24
string themselves we've provided them
08:27
with this from string method that they
08:30
can call and you see here that they are
08:33
just passing in this employee string one
08:36
and it comes in here and it splits that
08:39
string on the - and then creates a new
08:41
employee object and then returns that
08:44
employee object so now if I save this
08:46
and run it you can see that we got the
08:49
exact same values so now they'd have no
08:52
need to parse the strings anymore
08:54
we've provided them with a from string
08:57
alternative constructor and now they can
09:00
just pass in those strings and get their
09:02
new employee objects so when people say
09:04
that they use class methods as
09:06
alternative constructors then this is
09:08
what they mean now if you want to see a
09:10
real-world example of this then I have
09:12
the date/time module pulled up here and
09:15
there are several ways that we can
09:17
create new date times and if you search
09:19
for class method within the date/time
09:22
module then you can see an example of
09:24
some of these so the default way of
09:26
creating a date/time object is to say
09:29
something like date/time and then pass
09:31
in the year month and date but if we
09:34
look here at these class methods which
09:36
are alternative constructors then what
09:39
they do is they have this from time
09:41
stamp and you can use the current time
09:45
which is today and they have a couple of
09:47
other examples here as well and you can
09:49
see that they're basically doing the
09:51
same thing that we just did in our
09:53
example so you can see that they are
09:55
accepting the class and a timestamp with
09:58
this from time stamp constructor and
10:00
then they are parsing out some dates and
10:03
then they're creating that new date/time
10:05
object and returning that so it's a new
10:08
way of creating date/time objects so
10:11
that is very similar to the example that
10:13
we just wrote on our own so now if you
10:15
ever see something like this in code
10:17
then you'll know what's going on okay so
10:19
now that we looked at class methods now
10:21
let's talk about static methods now a
10:23
lot of people gets class methods and
10:25
static methods confused now when working
10:27
with classes regular methods
10:30
automatically pass the instance as the
10:32
first argument and we call that self and
10:35
class methods automatically pass the
10:38
class as the first argument and we call
10:41
that CLS and static methods don't pass
10:44
anything automatically they don't pass
10:47
the instance or the class so really they
10:50
behave just like regular functions
10:52
except we include them in our classes
10:54
because they have some logical
10:56
connection with the class so let's go
10:58
ahead and take a look at an example so
11:00
that we know what we mean here so I'm
11:02
going to go ahead and delete these lines
11:05
here so let's say that we wanted
11:08
a simple function that would take in a
11:10
date and return whether or not that was
11:13
a workday so that has a logical
11:17
connection to our employee class but it
11:19
doesn't actually depend on any specific
11:22
instance or class variable so instead
11:25
I'm going to make this a static method
11:27
so to create a static method it's just
11:30
as easy as a class method and we're also
11:33
going to use a decorator that decorator
11:35
is going to be static method so I'm
11:37
going to call this method is workday now
11:42
remember static methods don't take the
11:44
instance or the class as the first
11:46
argument so we can just pass in the
11:49
arguments that we want to work with and
11:50
I'm going to take in a day here and
11:53
return whether or not that is a workday
11:56
so to make this a simple example I'm not
11:58
going to do it to anything too
12:00
complicated I'm just going to return
12:01
whether or not our day falls on a
12:04
weekday so in Python dates have these
12:07
weekday methods where Monday is equal to
12:09
zero and Sunday is equal to six and all
12:13
the other days in between so if I wanted
12:15
to return whether this is a weekday and
12:18
I could just say they dot weekday if
12:21
that is equal to five well which is a
12:25
Saturday and I'm going to go ahead and
12:27
just copy this line here and say or if
12:30
that day is equal to six which is a
12:33
Sunday then I'm going to return false
12:36
and if it doesn't hit that conditional
12:39
then it means that it's a weekday so I'm
12:41
just going to return true now sometimes
12:44
people write regular methods or class
12:46
methods that actually should be static
12:49
methods and usually a giveaway that a
12:51
method should be a static method is if
12:54
you don't access the instance or the
12:56
class anywhere within the function so
12:59
say that I had this class method up here
13:02
you can see that I'm using that class
13:04
variable there but if I wasn't using it
13:07
anywhere within that method then it
13:10
probably doesn't need to be a class
13:12
method and the same with regular methods
13:14
if you're not using that self variable
13:16
then it's probably you probably want to
13:19
check and see if that would be
13:20
appropriate to use a static method
13:22
that place okay so now let's go down
13:24
here and see if our static method is
13:26
working so I'm just going to go ahead
13:28
and uncomment out these couple of lines
13:31
here and all I'm doing here is I'm
13:33
importing the eighth time module and
13:35
then I'm creating a new date and if I
13:38
wanted to use our new static method here
13:40
that checks whether this date is a
13:42
weekday then I can just print out the
13:44
employee dot is work day and pass in
13:49
that date so if I run that on I got an
13:52
error there because whenever I copied
13:55
and pasted I forgot to take out this
13:57
second if I really want that to say if
13:59
the weekday is equal to five or the
14:02
weekday is equal to six so now if I save
14:05
that and run it then you can see that
14:07
this day that I passed in is false
14:09
because that's actually a Sunday now if
14:12
I replace this with the 11th and run
14:15
that now you can see that it's a Monday
14:17
so you can see that his workday returns
14:20
true okay so I think that is going to do
14:23
it for this video in this video we
14:24
learned the difference between regular
14:26
instance methods class methods which can
14:29
also be used as alternative constructors
14:31
and static methods which don't operate
14:34
on the instance or the class so I hope
14:36
all of that made sense to everyone but
14:38
if you do have any questions about
14:40
anything that we cover then feel free to
14:41
ask in the comment section below and
14:43
I'll do my best to answer those in the
14:45
next tutorial we'll start looking at
14:46
inheritance and how we can make
14:48
subclasses now if you enjoy these
14:50
tutorials and would like to support them

14:53
