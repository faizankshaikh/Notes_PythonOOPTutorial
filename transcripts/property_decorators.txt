00:00 
hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01
this video we're going to be learning
00:02
how to use the property decorator now
00:05
this allows us to give our class
00:06
attributes getter setter and a leader
00:08
functionality like may have seen in some
00:10
other languages so if you've been
00:12
following along with my object-oriented
00:13
video so far you may have noticed that I
00:16
stripped down the employee class here a
00:17
bit and that's just so we can focus on
00:19
these attributes without the other code
00:21
getting in the way okay so so far with
00:23
our employee class some of you may have
00:25
noticed that our email attribute depends
00:27
on our first name and our last name so
00:29
when we create our employee object here
00:32
it comes into our and NIP method and it
00:35
sets the first name the last name then
00:37
it sets the email to our first name dot
00:40
last name @ email com and also we have
00:43
this full name method down here which
00:45
prints out the current first-name and
00:47
lastname together so if I go down here
00:50
and create this simple employee object
00:53
and then print out the first name email
00:55
and full name you can see that all of
00:58
these are what we would expect so the
00:59
first name is John the email is John
01:01
Smith at email comm and the full name is
01:04
both of those together so let's go here
01:07
and now let's set our employee dot
01:10
first-name I'm just gonna set that first
01:13
name equal to Jim and rerun this so you
01:16
can see down here that the first name
01:18
was changed to Jim but the email still
01:21
has our old first-name now the full name
01:24
method here doesn't have this problem
01:25
because every time we run the full name
01:28
method it comes in here and grabs the
01:30
current first-name and lastname so what
01:33
if the people who are using our class
01:34
said that we need to fix this so they
01:36
don't want to change the email every
01:38
time they change the first name or the
01:39
last name so they want us to make it to
01:41
where it updates the email automatically
01:43
when either the first name or the last
01:45
name has changed now your first thought
01:47
there might be to just create an email
01:49
method just like we did here with our
01:51
full name but the problem with that is
01:54
that it will break the code for everyone
01:56
currently using the class so they would
01:58
have to go through and change every
02:00
instance of the email attribute with an
02:02
email method now this is usually where
02:04
people from other languages like Java
02:06
will bring up the benefits of getter and
02:08
setter methods and it's a good point
02:10
because this is where getter and setter
02:12
really come in handy but we have the
02:14
ability to do this within Python using
02:16
the property decorator now the property
02:19
decorator allows us to define a method
02:21
but we can access it like an attribute
02:23
so for example let's go ahead and pull
02:26
this email attribute out into a method
02:28
similar to our full-name method so I'm
02:31
actually just going to copy the full
02:34
name method here and paste this in and
02:37
I'm going to call this email but instead
02:43
of printing this out like the first name
02:44
I'm going to print this out like our
02:46
email would show up so the first name
02:49
dot last name @ email comm and so now
02:54
I'm just going to come up here and
02:55
remove our email attribute and save that
02:58
so right now our email method is similar
03:01
to our full-name method so each time we
03:03
ran it it would get the current first
03:05
name and last name but we'd also have to
03:07
go through and change our code to where
03:10
every email attribute is a method call
03:12
so for example when I'm printing this
03:14
out down here out instead have to go
03:16
down here and add parentheses to this
03:18
dot email and so now if I run this here
03:21
you can see that this solved our problem
03:23
where it set our email address to the
03:26
new first name but this also means that
03:28
anyone using our class would have to
03:30
change their code also so that's not
03:33
what we want so let's go ahead and take
03:35
these parentheses back off so in order
03:38
to continue accessing email like an
03:40
attribute I can just add a property
03:43
decorator above this method so I'm going
03:46
to go ahead and add this on so this is
03:48
just at property and just by making that
03:51
small change now if I run our code then
03:54
you can see that that works so we're
03:57
defining our email in our class like
03:59
it's a method but we're able to access
04:01
it like an attribute and we could do
04:04
this just as easily with full name as
04:06
well so if I was to add this property
04:09
decorator onto full name and then take
04:12
off these parentheses there and run that
04:15
then you can see that that works also
04:17
now I know that goes against what I said
04:19
about changing the code but this is just
04:21
an example and I also wanted to use the
04:23
full name to show you an example of
04:25
you can use a setter so let's say for
04:27
example that we wanted the ability to
04:29
say employee one dot full name and set
04:34
it equal to let's just say quarry
04:36
Schaefer and let's say that by setting
04:38
this full name that we also wanted it to
04:41
change our first name our last name and
04:43
our email and right now we can't do this
04:46
so if we only have the full name with
04:48
the property decorator and I try to set
04:51
this like this if I run this here you
04:54
can see that we get an error there and
04:56
if we look at the error it says that we
04:58
can't set the attribute okay so for now
05:01
I'm just going to comment this out and
05:03
rerun that so in order to do what we
05:06
were trying to do there we're going to
05:08
have to use a setter and that's going to
05:10
be another decorator now this might look
05:12
a little strange but the name that we're
05:14
going to use for our setter is going to
05:16
be the name of the property so in this
05:19
case it's going to be full name so I'm
05:21
going to say at full name dot setter and
05:24
then underneath this decorator we just
05:27
need to create another method with the
05:29
same name so this is going to be a
05:31
method with full name this is going to
05:34
take in self and I'm going to call this
05:36
name now this name value here is the
05:39
value that we are trying to set so in
05:41
this case down here it would be this
05:43
full name here so I'm going to come in
05:46
here and we want to set the first name
05:48
and the last name using this full name
05:51
here so what we can do is we can just
05:54
split that name that we pass in on the
05:58
space separator so I'll say first last
06:01
is equal to name not split will split on
06:05
that space so that's going to split that
06:07
name into two parts and the first part
06:10
before the space will be the first name
06:12
and the second part after the space will
06:14
be the last name so now we want to set
06:18
our employees first name and last name
06:20
equal to those values so I can just say
06:22
self dot first is equal to first and
06:27
self dot last is equal to last so now
06:32
that I have that setter if I come down
06:35
here and uncomment out this line that
06:37
gave us an error before
06:38
and rerun that then you can see that
06:41
that works so what happened here is that
06:43
whenever we set this full name equal to
06:45
this name it came into our setter here
06:48
and it parsed the names from that value
06:51
that we set and then it set our first
06:53
name and last name and since we set the
06:56
first name and last name even when we
06:58
printed out our email it came in here
07:01
and grabbed those correct values they
07:04
can also make a deleter in the same way
07:06
so let's say that if I was to delete the
07:08
full name of our employee that I wanted
07:10
to run some kind of cleanup code so to
07:12
do this I'm just going to copy our
07:14
setter here and paste this in below but
07:19
instead of a setter this is going to be
07:21
a leader for full name the leader and
07:24
this won't be accepting any other values
07:27
other than self and I'll just go ahead
07:29
and remove these here and just so that
07:32
we can see this doing something within
07:34
here I'm just going to say delete name
07:38
and I'm also just going to do a self dot
07:42
first is equal to none and a self dot
07:47
last is equal to none so the deleter
07:51
code there is what gets run whenever we
07:53
delete an attribute so at the very
07:55
bottom here if I do a delete of employee
07:59
one dot full name and run that then you
08:04
can see here that it came in and ran
08:06
that print statement that was in our
08:08
deleter and also set our first name and
08:11
last name equal to none values okay so I
08:14
think that's going to do it for this
08:15
video I hope you got some ideas for how
08:17
you can use the property decorator
08:18
within your classes now this is a nice
08:20
feature because it allows us to access
08:22
attributes without putting getters and
08:25
setters everywhere but if we need that
08:27
functionality then it's easy to add in
08:29
with the property decorator and if you
08:31
do this correctly then people using our
08:33
class won't even need to change any of
08:35
their code because they'll still be able
08:37
to access those attributes in the same
08:39
way that they did before now that wasn't
08:41
exactly the case in our example here
08:42
because I changed the full name method
08:45
into an attribute but only did that
08:46
because I wanted to show how we could
08:48
use the full name as a setter to change
08:50
the first name and the last name
08:52
so you won't want to be careful with
08:54
changes like that if other people are
08:55
already using your classes so if anyone
08:58
has any questions about what we cover in
08:59
this video then feel free to ask in the
09:01
comment section below and I'll do my
09:02
best to answer those if you enjoy these
09:04
tutorials on the bike to sport then
09:06
there are several ways you can do that
09:07
now the easiest ways to simply like the
09:09
video and give it a thumbs up and also
09:10
