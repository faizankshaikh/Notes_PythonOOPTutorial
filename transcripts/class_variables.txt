00:00
hey there how's it going everybody in
00:01
the last video we learned how to create
00:03
a simple class and how to create
00:05
instances of that class we learned a lot
00:07
about instance variables which are used
00:10
for data that is unique to each instance
00:12
so instance variables are these here
00:14
that are set using the self argument
00:17
that we saw before so for example in the
00:20
employee class that we created we set
00:22
the names the email and the pay in our
00:25
Annette method and those are set for
00:27
each instance of the employee that we
00:29
create and I briefly mentioned class
00:31
variables in the last video but we
00:33
didn't go into detail and that's what
00:35
we're going to learn about in this video
00:36
so class variables are variables that
00:39
are shared among all instances of a
00:41
class
00:41
so while instance variables can be
00:43
unique for each instance like our names
00:46
and email and pay class variables should
00:49
be the same for each instance so if you
00:51
look here at our employee class what
00:53
kind of data would we want to be shared
00:55
among all employees well there's a lot
00:58
of different ideas that we could
01:00
probably come up with but for this
01:01
example let's say that our company gives
01:03
annual raises every year now the amount
01:06
can change from year to year but
01:08
whatever that amount is it's going to be
01:10
the same for all employees so that would
01:12
be a good candidate for a class variable
01:14
now before we actually create that class
01:16
variable let's first hard code this in
01:19
and see why the class variables would be
01:21
a better use case so I'm going to create
01:23
a method down here called apply raise
01:26
and remember our methods automatically
01:29
take in the instance which we are going
01:31
to call self now within this apply raise
01:34
I'm going to do a self dot pay and I'm
01:38
going to set this equal to an integer so
01:41
that we have a whole number and I'm
01:43
gonna do self dot pay times 1 point
01:47
let's just make this 4% so now if I was
01:50
to test this down here on an instance
01:52
then I can print out the employee 1 dot
01:56
pay and let me go ahead and copy this
01:59
twice and between here I'm going to do
02:02
an employee 1 dot apply raise now if I
02:07
go ahead and run this Oh actually forgot
02:09
to put in the parenthesis there so now
02:11
if I go ahead and run this
02:13
you can see that I printed out the pay
02:16
then we applied the raise and it added
02:18
4% onto our pay so we can see that it
02:21
worked but there are a couple of things
02:23
wrong here so first it would be nice if
02:26
we could access the raise amount by
02:29
doing something like employee 1 dot
02:32
raise amount or since it would apply to
02:36
the entire class we should also be able
02:38
to get the raise amount by doing
02:41
employee dot raise amount now that raise
02:44
amount attribute doesn't currently exist
02:46
so we can't see that it is 4% and also
02:50
what if I wanted to easily update that
02:53
4% amount so right now it's kind of
02:56
hidden within this method and for all I
02:59
know it could be in multiple places
03:01
throughout our code so we don't want to
03:04
have to manually go in if we wanted to
03:05
update this 4% we wouldn't want to have
03:08
to manually go in and change these and
03:10
multiple locations
03:11
so let's instead pull this 4% out into a
03:15
class variable and that's as easy as
03:18
going up here to the top of the class
03:20
and just saying that we want a raise
03:23
amount equal to one point and we'll just
03:26
do that at 4% still so now instead of
03:29
hard-coding this 4% down here and our
03:32
apply raise method now let's go ahead
03:34
and use this class variable now you
03:37
might expect us to just be able to type
03:40
in raise amount here but if I save that
03:44
and I'm going to comment out these lines
03:47
here so if I save that and run it you
03:49
can see that I got a name error and it
03:52
says that raise amount is not defined
03:55
and that's because when we access these
03:57
class variables we need to either access
04:00
them through the class itself or an
04:02
instance of the class so within the
04:05
apply raise I could either say employee
04:08
not raise amount and if I save that and
04:11
run it then you can see that that works
04:13
or I can also access through the
04:17
instance so I can do self dot raise
04:19
amount and if I run that then you can
04:21
see that that works as well now that
04:23
might be a little confusing to you
04:24
because if these are class variables
04:27
and why can we access them from our
04:29
instance so let me print out a few lines
04:32
here to get a better idea of what's
04:34
going on so I'm going to go ahead and
04:36
remove all of these lines here actually
04:39
I'm going to keep this and I'm going to
04:41
print out the employee one dot rays
04:44
amount and I'm also going to print the
04:48
employee that rays amount and also just
04:52
to see all of our instances here I'm
04:54
going to also do the employee two trays
04:58
amount so that we can see all of them
05:00
together so now if I go ahead and print
05:04
these out you can see that I can access
05:07
this class variable from both my class
05:09
itself as well as from both instances
05:12
now what's going on here
05:14
is that when we try to access an
05:16
attribute on an instance it will first
05:18
check if the instance contains that
05:20
attribute and if it doesn't then it will
05:23
see if the class or any class that it
05:25
inherits from contains that attribute so
05:28
when we access rays amount from our
05:31
instances here they don't actually have
05:33
that attribute themselves they're
05:35
accessing the class's raiseamount
05:37
attribute now there's a little trick
05:39
that we can do here to get a better idea
05:41
of what's going on so I'm going to go
05:43
ahead and print out the namespace of
05:46
employee one and we can do that by
05:49
printing out employee one double
05:52
underscore vicked
05:53
it's now if I run this if I were to
05:56
access these names or email or pay then
06:00
these are the values that they would
06:02
return but you can see that there's no
06:04
raise amount here in this list now if I
06:08
print it out the employee dict and run
06:11
that now we're gonna get a few things
06:13
here that we don't necessarily care
06:15
about but if we look down here
06:18
and we can see that the class does
06:20
contain this raise amount attribute and
06:22
that is the value that our instances see
06:25
when we access that raise amount
06:27
attribute from our instances now let me
06:30
show you an important concept here so
06:32
I'm going to go ahead and comment this
06:35
out and I'm going to take this employee
06:37
raise them out and I'm going to
06:40
set this equal to one point zero five
06:44
and now I'm going to uncomment out our
06:46
print statements here and rerun this
06:48
code and you can see that it changed the
06:51
Rays amount for the class and all of the
06:54
instances now what if I was to set the
06:57
Rays amount using an instance instead of
07:00
using the class so instead of doing
07:02
employee dot rays amount equals five
07:05
percent I'm going to say employee one
07:07
dot rays amount equals five percent so
07:10
if I run this now now this might be a
07:13
little unexpected you can see that it
07:15
only changed the Rays amount for
07:17
employee one it's the only one that has
07:20
this five percent so why did it do that
07:23
well when we made this assignment it
07:25
actually created the Rays amount
07:28
attribute within employee one so if I go
07:31
back up here and print back out employee
07:36
ones namespace and I'm going to do this
07:39
under the assignment so now if I run
07:42
that now you can see that employee one
07:45
has raised amount within its name space
07:48
equal to five percent and it finds this
07:52
within its own namespace and returns
07:53
that value before going and searching
07:56
the class and we didn't set that raise
07:59
amount on employee two so that still
08:02
falls back to the classes value now
08:04
that's an important concept to
08:06
understand because up here and our apply
08:08
rays method we can see that we could get
08:11
different results depending on whether
08:13
we did the self which is the instance
08:16
raised amount or the employee class
08:19
raise amount so in this case I think I'm
08:22
going to go ahead and leave this as self
08:24
dot raise amount because that will give
08:27
us the ability to change that amount for
08:29
a single instance if we really wanted to
08:31
so if I wanted to change employee ones
08:34
raise amount then I could go ahead and
08:36
do that and when I did apply raise then
08:40
it would use the employee ones raise
08:42
amount instead of the classes raise
08:44
amount and also using self here will
08:47
allow any subclass to override that
08:50
constant if they wanted to and we'll
08:53
look at sub classing and
08:54
future video so now let's look at
08:56
another example of a class variable
08:57
where it wouldn't really make sense to
09:00
use self so let's say that we wanted to
09:03
keep track of how many employees that we
09:05
have so the number of employees should
09:08
be the same for all instances of our
09:10
class so if I created a class variable
09:13
up here I'm just gonna go ahead and call
09:15
this num of employees is equal to zero
09:20
for now and each time we create a new
09:22
employee I'm going to increment that by
09:25
one and I can do that within the knit
09:28
method since the knit method runs every
09:31
time we create a new employee so within
09:34
here I'm going to do employee dot number
09:38
of employees plus equals one now I'm
09:42
definitely gonna use employee that
09:43
number of employees here instead of self
09:46
dot number of employees because with the
09:49
raises it's nice to have that constant
09:51
class value that can be overridden per
09:54
instance if we really need it to be but
09:56
in this case there's no use case I can
09:58
think of where we would want our total
10:01
number of employees to be different for
10:03
any one instance so for now I'm going to
10:06
go down here to the bottom and go ahead
10:09
and delete all of this and I'm going to
10:12
print out employee dot number of
10:16
employees so now if I go ahead and run
10:18
that you can see that it returned two
10:21
because it was incremented twice when we
10:24
instantiated both of our employees here
10:26
if I was to put this print statement
10:29
above where we instantiated those
10:31
employees then you can see that it was
10:33
zero and we created two employees and
10:36
then it printed out - okay so I think
10:38
that is going to do it for this video
10:40
now I know that that was a lot to take
10:42
in but hopefully now you better
10:44
understand the difference between
10:45
instance variables and class variables
10:47
and when you would use each one so one
10:49
of the obvious next questions is well if
10:52
we have class variables then are there
10:54
also class methods and the answer is yes
10:57
there are these things called static
10:59
methods and also class methods and we'll
11:02
look at the difference between those in
11:03
the next video but if you do have any
11:05
